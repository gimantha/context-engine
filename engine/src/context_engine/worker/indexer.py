"""Converge the knowledge backend to the ledger, one record at a time (ADR 0007).

The ledger says which partition and version each record should have; `record_locations`
says where copies actually are. Each call compares the two and writes, replaces, moves, or
removes copies until they match. Every backend write records its intent first, so a crash is
detected on the next attempt instead of being repeated blindly (ADR 0006). Every removal and
replacement is followed by a check that the old version is gone.
